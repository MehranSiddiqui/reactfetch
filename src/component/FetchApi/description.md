Description:

The code starts by importing React and the useEffect function.
It then creates a new FetchApi class that uses state to store an array of images, and useEffect to call getApiData when it is done fetching data from the API.
The code starts by creating a div with the class name "div-container".
Inside this div, there are two nested arrays: Images and setImages.
The Images array stores all of the images in our app while setImages stores what image should be displayed on each page.
Next, we create a function called getApiData which will retrieve data from our API using async/await .
This function returns JSON data so we can pass it into setImages later on in order to display them properly on each page.
We also define an effect handler for when getApiData finishes running so that it calls itself again after retrieving more data from the API if needed (which is why we have [] as its last argument).
The code is a React component that fetches the list of images from the Picsum API.
The code uses useState to manage its state, and useEffect to manage its side effects.
